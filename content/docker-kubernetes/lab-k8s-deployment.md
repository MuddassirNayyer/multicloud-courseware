# Lab: Kubernetes Deployment

Login to Google Cloud Console

As a reminder GCP API's are eventually consistent, we may need to wait here and there

Create a new project `gcp-k8s` where to launch new GKE Cluster

Select newly created project from the drop-down list and navigate to `Kubernetes Engine`and wait for the API being enabled

Select `Create cluster` once the API has been enabled

Choose the `Your first cluster` and provide a name

For location type select `zonal` and select a desired location

Select the default version of the cluster from the drop-down list
