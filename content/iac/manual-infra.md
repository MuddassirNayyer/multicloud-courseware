# Manual Infrastructure

* A ticket required for new VM's by a developer
* Another ticket for firewall port opening by a software architect
* Another ticket for load-balancer configuration by a team lead
* A couple of meetings to review the requirements
* A possible escalation is required through VP due to a short notice
* Manual configuration of VM, Load-Balancer and Firewall by different individuals/teams
* Manual configuration by the developer on each provisioned VM
* An error-prone, hardly reliable or reproducible process
* Scalable to dozens, maybe, hundreds of instances
