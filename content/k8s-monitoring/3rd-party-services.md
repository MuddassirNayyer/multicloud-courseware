* Similarly to infrastructure monitoring there is enough competition
* A variety of [on-premises tools and cloud services](https://rancher.com/learning-paths/best-practices-for-monitoring-and-alerting-on-kubernetes/)
* Consolidated monitoring across clusters, regions, and providers
* Helps to bring all monitoring data under one roof
* Possibly, more appealing GUI
