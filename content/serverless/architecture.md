[![](/media/serverless-architecture.jpg)](https://www.slideshare.net/AmazonWebServices/application-lifecycle-management-in-a-serverless-world-73808231)

* An event-source, whether an end-points, a file upload, a database update or a queue message
* A code running in a container, with limited request execution time, limited memory
* Cloud infrastructure takes care of provisioning, scaling, and decommissioning
* Other services/resource can be leveraged from the serverless code
